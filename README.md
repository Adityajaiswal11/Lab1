# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
This Python script performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset to summarize its main characteristics and uncover patterns, spot anomalies, test hypotheses, and check assumptions using visualizations and statistical techniques.

Features
Data Summary: The script provides key statistical summaries such as mean, median, mode, variance, and more for each feature.
Handling Missing Data: It identifies and summarizes missing data in the dataset.
Data Visualization: Various visualizations such as histograms, boxplots, correlation heatmaps, and pairplots are generated to understand the distribution of data and relationships between features.
Correlation Analysis: The script calculates correlation between numerical features and generates a heatmap to highlight strong or weak relationships.
Outlier Detection: Boxplots and other visualizations are used to detect and highlight potential outliers in the data.
Categorical Analysis: For categorical features, the script provides frequency counts and bar charts to visualize distributions.

How It Works
Loading the Data: The script loads the dataset from a CSV file into a pandas DataFrame.
Data Overview: It provides a high-level summary of the data using functions like info() and describe(). This includes data types, number of entries, and descriptive statistics for numerical features.
Missing Values Analysis: The script checks for missing values and displays their counts for each column.
Univariate Analysis: It analyzes individual features, providing distribution plots (histograms for numerical and bar plots for categorical data).
Multivariate Analysis: It analyzes relationships between multiple features, including scatter plots and correlation matrices.
Outlier Detection: Boxplots are used to detect outliers in numerical features.
Visualization: The script uses seaborn and matplotlib for visualizations to better understand the data.

Steps in the Analysis
Data Overview:

head(), info(), and describe() give insights into the data structure and statistical summaries.
Identifies missing values and data types for each column.
Univariate Analysis:

Histograms show the distribution of numerical variables.
Count plots visualize the distribution of categorical features.
Outlier Detection:

Boxplots highlight potential outliers in the dataset.
Multivariate Analysis:

Scatterplots, pair plots, and heatmaps analyze relationships between features, identifying trends, clusters, and correlations.
Correlation Analysis:

A correlation matrix and heatmap provide insights into how numerical features relate to each other.
Visualizations:

Visualizations are created using seaborn and matplotlib for better understanding of the data.
Parameters
Dataset: The input dataset must be a CSV file that can be loaded using pandas.
Columns: Users should ensure that the column names in the dataset match the ones referenced in the code.
Features: The analysis adjusts dynamically based on the types of features (numerical or categorical) in the dataset.
Visualization Types
Histogram: Used for visualizing the distribution of numerical data.
Boxplot: Helps in detecting outliers in continuous features.
Correlation Heatmap: Visualizes the correlation between numerical features.
Count Plot: Displays the frequency distribution of categorical variables.
Pairplot: Shows scatterplots for relationships between pairs of features.
